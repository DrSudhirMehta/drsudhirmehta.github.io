          <h2>Startups Don’t Fail Because of Product Problems</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Startups don’t fail because of product problems. They fail because of people problems.</p>
        <p>This line has stuck with me for years — in fintech, in startups, in consulting.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hiring is easy. Building trust is hard.</li>
          <li>Equity is easy. Alignment is hard.</li>
          <li>Ideas are easy. Teams are hard.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My upcoming book <em>Winning Startup Teams</em> is about solving exactly this — before it breaks you.</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What’s the hardest part of building your team?</p>

          <h2>Why Startups Fail (Even With a Great Idea)</h2>
        </header>
        <p>This week, I shared that most startups don’t fail because of product problems. They fail because of people problems.</p>
        <p>And the patterns are painfully familiar:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Founders pulling in different directions.</li>
          <li>Unclear roles and decision rights.</li>
          <li>Communication that breaks under stress.</li>
          <li>Culture that quietly erodes as the team grows.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These aren’t side issues. <strong>They are the startup.</strong></p>
        <p>In <em>Winning Startup Teams</em>, I explore how founders can identify and fix these cracks early — before the real pressure hits.</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What’s the one team mistake you wish you had caught earlier?</p>

          <h2>Entrepreneurial Traits &amp; Capabilities (ETC): A Clarity Tool</h2>
        </header>
        <p>A good product with a bad team won’t scale. But a great team with an evolving product? That’s startup magic.</p>
        <p>Over the past year, I’ve been building something to help founders get team decisions right — earlier. One of the core frameworks I’ve developed is the <strong>Entrepreneurial Traits &amp; Capabilities (ETC) Model</strong> — a tool to help founders understand how their personality traits shape leadership, co-founder fit, and hiring moves.</p>
        <p>It’s not a personality test. It’s a clarity tool. It is designed to help founders build teams intentionally — not accidentally.</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Would you use something like this with your team or portfolio companies?</p>

          <h2>Your Biggest Risk Isn’t Competition. It’s Team Breakdown.</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Think your startup’s biggest risk is competition or funding? It’s not. It’s your team breaking down before you scale up.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Misalignment.</li>
          <li>Ego clashes.</li>
          <li>Hiring mistakes.</li>

        <p>These kill momentum long before the product does. But great teams spot the cracks early and fix them.</p>
        <p>In <em>Winning Startup Teams</em>, I break down what sets strong teams apart — and how founders can build team resilience from day one.</p>

        <p>When I started this journey, I thought the book was about building winning teams. And it is. But it’s also about something bigger:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The transition from scrappy beginnings to sustainable growth.</li>
          <li>The hard truths founders face after the garage stage.</li>
          <li>The team dynamics that can make or break that journey.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Beyond the Garage</em> felt more honest. More real. It’s about what happens after the idea, after the early hustle — when you need to lead, align, and scale.</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What do you think — does the new title resonate?</p>

          <h2>Before You Split Equity, Align Your Expectations</h2>
        </header>
        <p><em>“Before you split equity, align your expectations.”</em> Early equity decisions shape more than ownership — they shape trust.</p>
        <p>In <em>Beyond the Garage</em>, I talk about how the equity split isn’t just math — it’s a mirror for how aligned you really are. Because the real work isn’t dividing shares — it’s aligning expectations before the pressure hits.</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> How did you and your co-founder decide what was fair?</p>

          <h2>Equity Splits Can Unite — or Quietly Tear a Team Apart</h2>
        </header>
        <p>I’ve seen too many founding teams delay the tough equity conversation because “we’ll figure it out later.” But misaligned expectations about contributions, roles, or risk-sharing always catch up — usually when it’s too late.</p>
        <p>It’s not about formulas. It’s about clarity, trust, and alignment — early.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Who’s bringing what to the table?</li>
          <li>Who’s staying in through the ups and downs?</li>
          <li>What does “fair” really mean to each of you?</li>

        </header>
        <p>The first 10 hires, the co-founder relationship, the equity split, the leadership dynamic… None of these break overnight. They break slowly — through unspoken assumptions, blurred roles, and misaligned expectations.</p>
        <p>That’s how company culture erodes. Not through one big failure, but through a thousand small ones.</p>
        <p>Like the Roman Colosseum, most cultures don’t collapse in a single dramatic moment. They wear down — slowly, silently — through misalignment, mixed signals, and unresolved tension.</p>
        <p>In <em>Beyond the Garage</em>, I keep coming back to one core idea: Clarity isn’t optional. It’s oxygen. Especially when the pressure hits.</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What’s one moment where your culture held — or cracked — under pressure?</p>

        <p>Culture erodes when leaders check out. It strengthens when they step in — with clarity, empathy, and presence.</p>
        <p>In <em>Beyond the Garage</em>, I talk about what leadership really looks like during the messy middle:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When roles blur</li>
          <li>When conflict flares</li>
          <li>When the path forward isn’t obvious</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That’s when founders transition from “wearing all the hats” to actually leading a team. It’s not about being the loudest in the room. It’s about making sure everyone still hears the mission.</p>

        </header>
        <p>I started writing <em>Beyond the Garage</em> to unpack what I’d seen go wrong in startup teams. But somewhere along the way, it became something else. It became a mirror.</p>
        <p>Writing about leadership forced me to revisit the moments I was too slow to decide. Too quiet in the room. Too attached to being right. Too uncertain to let go.</p>
        <p>I didn’t want to write just another paper that sits on a shelf. I wanted to take the research I’d done — and the experiences I’d lived — and make it useful. Something founders, early teams, and those who support them could apply right away.</p>
        <p>Leadership isn’t about having all the answers. It’s about holding the space — for clarity, for conflict, for growth.</p>
        <p>If this book helps even one founder avoid the mistakes I’ve seen (or made), it’s worth it.</p>

          <h2>Three Characteristics of Strong Startup Teams</h2>
        </header>
        <p>My research found that the strongest startup teams shared three key characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Founders who were agreeable, not just confident</li>
          <li>Teams aligned around a clear vision, not just words on a page</li>
          <li>Cultures built on shared leadership, not just a single dominant voice</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That’s why these traits are at the heart of <em>Beyond the Garage</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Have you seen these dynamics play out in your own team?</p>

          <h2>Build Trust That Lasts</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Most founders obsess over what to build. But the best ones also obsess over who they’re building it with.</p>
        <p>Early team breakdowns aren’t caused by bad ideas or weak markets — they’re caused by mismatched personalities, unspoken assumptions, and trust that erodes under pressure.</p>
        <p>That’s why I created tools like the <strong>Co-Founder Fit Quiz</strong> and the <strong>Conflict Resolution Worksheet</strong> — because building something that lasts starts with building trust that lasts.</p>
        <p>Ask yourself:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do we have clarity on how decisions get made?</li>
          <li>Do we know how we’ll resolve disagreements when — not if — they arise?</li>
          <li>Do we trust each other enough to be honest?</li>

          <li>Are we aligned on the new direction?</li>
          <li>Do we have the trust to challenge each other — and still move forward?</li>
          <li>Are we steady at the core, even as everything else changes?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Founders often believe success starts with a brilliant idea. But the real challenge? Building the right team to bring that idea to life — and to adapt when the idea needs to change.</p>
        <p>In <em>Beyond the Garage</em>, I explore the most common pitfalls founders face — not in the business model, but in the people model:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Confusing shared enthusiasm with alignment</li>
          <li>Delaying tough conversations about equity, roles, or leadership gaps</li>
          <li>Mistaking tension for “healthy conflict” when trust is breaking down</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These insights are drawn from real-world founder journeys, research, and hard-won lessons. <strong>Available on Amazon starting July 4 — <em>Beyond the Garage</em>.</strong></p>

          <h2>Why Do Most Startups Fail?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Not because of tech. Not because of timing. Because the team falls apart — misaligned co-founders, unclear roles, broken trust.</p>
        <p>Whether you’re hiring your first 10 employees or leading a cross-functional team inside a larger company, the lessons are the same:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Build alignment early</li>
          <li>Handle conflict before it festers</li>
          <li>Design your team, don’t just grow it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you’ve ever experienced the pain of a team that should have worked — but didn’t — I’d love to hear what you learned.</p>
        <p><strong>DM me</strong> — I’ll share a few lessons from my research that might help.</p>
